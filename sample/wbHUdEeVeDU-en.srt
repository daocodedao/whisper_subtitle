0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:05.400
It's an astonishing achievement that Elon Musk, by his mid-forties, would manage to create four multi-billion dollar companies in four different fields,
2
0:00:05.400 --> 0:00:11.900
like software, energy, aerospace, and transportation.
3
0:00:11.900 --> 0:00:17.380
So what's the secret behind his success? Elon is known for his incredible resilience,
4
0:00:17.380 --> 0:00:22.800
his tireless work ethic, and relentless pursuit of groundbreaking innovations. It's reported that Elon Musk regularly works more than a hundred hours every week.
5
0:00:22.800 --> 0:00:27.900
The most striking part of Elon's character as a young boy was his compulsion to read. From a very young age,
6
0:00:27.900 --> 0:00:34.980
he seemed to have a book in his hands at all times.
7
0:00:35.280 --> 0:00:42.340
His brother Kimball Musk said it was not unusual for him to read 10 hours a day. If it was the weekend, he could go through two books in a day.
8
0:00:42.580 --> 0:00:48.320
The family went on numerous shopping excursions in which they realized mid-trip that Elon had gone missing.
9
0:00:48.660 --> 0:00:57.220
May or Kimball would pop into the nearest bookstore and find Elon somewhere near the back, sitting on the floor and reading a book, completely ignorant of his surroundings.
10
0:00:57.220 --> 0:01:04.420
As Elon got older, he would take himself to the bookstore when school ended at 2 p.m. and stay there until about 6 p.m.
11
0:01:04.480 --> 0:01:10.800
When his parents returned home from work, he plowed through fiction books and then comics and then non-fiction titles.
12
0:01:11.560 --> 0:01:16.980
Elon said, sometimes they kicked me out of the store, but usually not. He listed The Lord of the Rings,
13
0:01:17.280 --> 0:01:26.280
Isaac Asimov's Foundation series, and Robert Heinlein's The Moon is a Harsh Mistress as some of his favorites, alongside The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.
14
0:01:26.280 --> 0:01:31.840
Elon said, at one point I ran out of books to read at the school library and the neighborhood library.
15
0:01:32.080 --> 0:01:37.360
This is maybe the third or fourth grade. I tried to convince the librarian to order books for me.
16
0:01:37.540 --> 0:01:42.840
So then I started to read the Encyclopedia Britannica. That was so helpful it makes you realize,
17
0:01:43.220 --> 0:01:47.200
you don't know what you don't know. You realize there are all these things out there.
18
0:01:47.460 --> 0:01:52.300
Elon read through two sets of encyclopedias. It did little to help him make friends.
19
0:01:52.300 --> 0:01:57.580
Elon had a photographic memory, and the encyclopedias turned him into a fact factory.
20
0:01:58.020 --> 0:02:03.020
He came off as a classic know-it-all. At the dinner table, his sister Tosca Musk would wonder aloud about the distance from Earth to the moon.
21
0:02:03.020 --> 0:02:09.320
Elon would spit out the exact distance at Perigee and Apogee.
22
0:02:09.660 --> 0:02:14.920
His mother May Musk said, if we had a question, Tosca would always say, just ask Genius Boy.
23
0:02:15.320 --> 0:02:19.680
We could ask him about anything, he just remembered it. Elon cemented his bookworm reputation through his clumsy ways. May said,
24
0:02:19.680 --> 0:02:25.560
one night Elon was playing outside with his siblings and cousins. When one of them complained of being frightened by the dark,
25
0:02:25.560 --> 0:02:31.160
Elon pointed out that dark is merely the absence of light.
26
0:02:31.160 --> 0:02:37.000
It did little to reassure the scared child. May said,
27
0:02:37.460 --> 0:02:43.080
other kids don't like answers like that. They would say, Elon, we are not playing with you anymore.
28
0:02:43.460 --> 0:02:49.480
As a youngster, Elon's constant yearning to correct people and his abrasive manner put off other kids and added to his feelings of isolation.
29
0:02:49.480 --> 0:02:54.520
Elon genuinely thought that people would be happy to hear about the flaws in their thinking. May said,
30
0:02:54.520 --> 0:02:59.900
I felt very sad as a mother because I think Elon wanted friends.
31
0:02:59.900 --> 0:03:05.340
Kimball and Tosca would bring home friends and Elon wouldn't and he would want to play with them.
32
0:03:05.340 --> 0:03:11.080
But he was awkward. May urged Kimball and Tosca to include Elon. The kids would later say,
33
0:03:11.080 --> 0:03:16.900
but mom, he's not fun. As Elon got older, however, he would have strong affectionate to his siblings and cousins. Though Elon kept to himself at school,
34
0:03:16.900 --> 0:03:23.220
he had an outgoing nature with
35
0:03:23.220 --> 0:03:28.420
members of his family and eventually took on the role of elder and chief instigator among them.
36
0:03:28.680 --> 0:03:33.700
Even though his childhood is complicated, certainly the long hours that Elon invested in reading in the early days contributed massively to his career in a major way.
37
0:03:33.700 --> 0:03:39.580
Whenever anyone asks Elon how he learned to build space traveling rockets,
38
0:03:39.580 --> 0:03:45.400
his three word answer is, I read books. When Elon started SpaceX,
39
0:03:45.400 --> 0:03:50.200
he didn't know much about building rockets. He hired some really sharp people like Tom Mueller,
40
0:03:50.200 --> 0:03:55.940
who was a rocket engine designer. Tom and other employees said, Elon would ask questions constantly like,
41
0:03:55.940 --> 0:04:01.460
why did you do it that way? At first, Tom thought Elon was testing whether they knew their stuff.
42
0:04:01.460 --> 0:04:07.240
Then they realized he was learning from them. Elon also would ask,
43
0:04:07.400 --> 0:04:11.880
what is the physics behind that? He understood physics, but had to convert that to applied
44
0:04:12.720 --> 0:04:17.880
between learning from a lot of really sharp people he hired and reading textbooks on it.
45
0:04:18.360 --> 0:04:24.880
He has become a self-taught rocket scientist and quite a competent one. The common belief is that in order to become world class,
46
0:04:24.880 --> 0:04:30.460
one should only concentrate on one field. Elon breaks that rule.
47
0:04:30.960 --> 0:04:36.440
His expertise ranges from rocket science, engineering, physics, and artificial intelligence to solar power and energy. Musk has long been celebrated for his work ethic,
48
0:04:36.440 --> 0:04:42.660
his extraordinary schedule,
49
0:04:42.660 --> 0:04:47.960
a long working day broken into five minute increments so that every second is accounted for.
50
0:04:47.960 --> 0:04:53.200
His lunch is usually wolfed down in a meeting for some years now. And certainly,
51
0:04:53.460 --> 0:04:58.880
Musk has more on his plate than many chief executives. I hope you liked this video. Thanks for watching.
