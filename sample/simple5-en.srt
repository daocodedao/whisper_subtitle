0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:02.580
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 60.
2
0:00:02.580 --> 0:00:05.580
This is how many books an average CEO reads a year.
3
0:00:05.580 --> 0:00:07.820
Here are some hacks that would help you reach that number.
4
0:00:10.820 --> 0:00:12.740
The moment there is a book that you're not feeling,
5
0:00:12.740 --> 0:00:14.260
just throw it away, don't worry about it,
6
0:00:14.260 --> 0:00:15.900
and take a book that you really, really like.
7
0:00:15.900 --> 0:00:17.340
That way you will make it a habit.
8
0:00:17.340 --> 0:00:20.220
Set yourself embarrassingly tiny goals.
9
0:00:20.220 --> 0:00:22.900
For example, instead of wanting to read a book a week,
10
0:00:22.900 --> 0:00:23.980
which is quite a big goal,
11
0:00:23.980 --> 0:00:26.700
set yourself a goal to read half a page before sleep.
12
0:00:26.700 --> 0:00:28.020
That way you can't check it out.
13
0:00:28.020 --> 0:00:30.100
When you're chilling or waiting for something,
14
0:00:30.100 --> 0:00:31.300
you naturally get distracted.
15
0:00:31.300 --> 0:00:33.060
And then the thing that you do is you grab a phone.
16
0:00:33.060 --> 0:00:35.180
So set a screen saver that says,
17
0:00:35.180 --> 0:00:37.180
read more or read a book instead.
18
0:00:37.180 --> 0:00:39.540
That way instead of scoring social media, you'll be reading.
19
0:00:39.540 --> 0:00:41.220
Your brain gets bored really quickly.
20
0:00:41.220 --> 0:00:43.340
In order to make it exciting for yourself,
21
0:00:43.340 --> 0:00:45.100
read in a few different languages.
22
0:00:45.100 --> 0:00:47.460
Studies also show that it literally speeds up
23
0:00:47.460 --> 0:00:48.580
your cognitive ability.
24
0:00:48.580 --> 0:00:51.420
Force yourself to read in situations and settings
25
0:00:51.420 --> 0:00:52.660
when it's least convenient.
26
0:00:52.660 --> 0:00:54.060
For example, in the shower.
27
0:00:54.060 --> 0:00:55.520
That way, when you're chilled,
28
0:00:55.520 --> 0:00:57.460
reading on a sofa and extra fireplace,
29
0:00:57.460 --> 0:00:58.460
will be a piece of cake.
