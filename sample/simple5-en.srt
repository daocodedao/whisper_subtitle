0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:04.200
Have you ever wondered what would happen if your helicopter's engine stopped working in mid-flight?
2
0:00:04.320 --> 0:00:07.360
Does the helicopter crashes like a brick, as the scientist tweeted?
3
0:00:07.500 --> 0:00:10.960
Well, in those critical moments, as gravity starts pulling the chopper down,
4
0:00:11.020 --> 0:00:13.260
and the air rushes upwards through the rotor blades,
5
0:00:13.440 --> 0:00:16.720
the pilot immediately enters auto-rotation mode by lowering the lever.
6
0:00:16.840 --> 0:00:21.240
This changes the angle of the blades, and they start spinning freely only by the upward airflow,
7
0:00:21.400 --> 0:00:23.720
providing some lift as it rapidly goes down.
8
0:00:23.800 --> 0:00:28.700
Next, just before what seems like a crash landing, the pilot pulls the lever to slow the descent even more,
9
0:00:28.700 --> 0:00:30.920
giving just enough lift to cushion the landing.
